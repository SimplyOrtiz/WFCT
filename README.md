Wave Function Collapse Testing is a fork of [NDWFC](https://github.com/LingDong-/ndwfc).
At the moment, it only implements some small quality-of-life improvements to the code, but there are plans to add new types of tilesets.

### [Original Project Demo](https://ndwfc.glitch.me/)

- Based on the algorithm of [the original Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).
- Infinitely expandable canvas.
- 2D/3D/ND support.
